Omnistack Week was a workshop powered by Rocketseat.
In this workshop we learned to develop an application called Be The Hero, from the backend to the frontend (web & mobile), with only one language, JavaScript.
The application is a platform for NGOs to sign up and create the incidents that they need help.

## Installation
After git clone, do the following commands:
```bash
npm install

npm start
```
## Project
The back-end was developed with NodeJS and SQLite. This api uses Knex.
The routes to access the api are in the routes.js file. 

## Front-End (Web & Mobile)
The front-end was developed with ReactJS.
The page of the Be The Hero will be opened. In this page, a NGO can sign up and create their incidents. The NGO will also be able to contact others NGOs to help them.
